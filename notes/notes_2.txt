Python Comments:

if __name__ == "__main__":
     main()
- Executes main() only if the file is run directly, not when imported.

Script vs Module:
- Script: Executable code (run directly).
- Module: Code library (imported into other code).

"cProfile":
- Optimization tool for profiling Python scripts.
- Provides total running time, per-function time, and call counts.

"-m" Flag:
- Runs a module as a script, e.g., python -m cProfile myscript.py.

"range()":
- Returns an iterable object that generates numbers on demand.

Executing Hello.py:
- python Hello.py
- Make the file executable and run Hello.py
- Import in the interpreter: import Hello

Shebang Line "#! /usr/bin/env python3":
- Indicates the script should be run with Python.
- Helps Unix-like OS recognize and execute the script with the specified interpreter.

Collatz Conjecture:

take a positive integer:
if even, divide by 2.
if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
Repeat until reaching 1.

Example sequences: 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1.
cycle length of 5 is 6
cycle length of 10 is 7

Assertions:

assertions are not appropriate for testing code
unit test frameworks like Python's unittest are

assert is NOT good for testing
assert is NOT good for user error

they are appropriate for programmer errors
exceptions will be the correct tool for user errors

When an assertion fails, it stops the program. When I am testing a program. 
I do not want the program to stop. I need to complete all tests. 
That's why we use unit testing.
