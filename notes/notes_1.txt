Software Engineering Overview

Origin:

The term "software engineering" emerged at a NATO conference in Germany in 1968 to address a software crisis 
caused by increasing hardware complexity and development challenges.

Crisis Manifestations:

Over-budget projects
Delayed projects
Inefficient software
Low-quality software
Requirements not met
Unmanageable projects and hard-to-maintain code

Software Activities vs. Development Models:

Software Activities: Analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
Development Models: Abstract representations of development processes. Key models include:

1. Waterfall

2. Incremental

3. Reuse-oriented

Definition:

According to IEEE, Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, 
quantifiable approach to software development, operation, and maintenance, and 
the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.
